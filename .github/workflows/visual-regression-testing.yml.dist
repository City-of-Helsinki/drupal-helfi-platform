# The concurrency group is used to make sure only one visual regression test
# can be run at a time. Running multiple tests in parallel can cause a race
# condition with GitHub Pages deployments.
# Due to GitHub's limitation, only one test suite can be queued and run at
# a time; any additional run will be canceled automatically and must be
# re-started manually.
